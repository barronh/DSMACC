CH3OOH + hv -> Products
"Vaghjiani and Ravishankara [310] mesured the cross sections of CH3OOH by
monitoring the CH3OOH concentration via trapping and titration.  These results
are recommended and are listed in Table 24.  The earlier results of Molina and
Arguello [210] are consistently 40% higher than the values shown in Table 24;
this difference is believed to be due to difficulty in trapping CH3OOH and
measuring its concentration.  CH3OOH dissociates upon light absorption to give
CH3O with unit quantum yield (Vaghjiani and Ravishankara, [311]);  these
authors also observed some production of H and O atmos at shorter wavelengths
(i.e. 193 nm).  Thelen et al. [302] report unit quantum yield for OH
production at 248 and 193 nm, in agreement with the results of Vaghjiani and
Ravishankara."
